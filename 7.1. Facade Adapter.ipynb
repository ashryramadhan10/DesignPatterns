    "\n",
    "The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. The goal is to make the subsystem easier to use by hiding its complexities. Hereâ€™s an example of implementing the Facade pattern in Python, including the use of abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Facade Pattern works similar like handler in clean architecture.\n",
    "* Facade will wrap every interfaces or concrete classes that need to be work together\n",
    "* Facade will have methods that make all the interfaces can work together in a context"
